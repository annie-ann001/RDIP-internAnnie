	              In software engineering, version control is a class of systems responsible for managing changes to computer programs, documents, large web sites, or
	              other collections of information.Version control systems help a software team manage changes to source code over time. Version control software keeps 
		      track of every modification to the code in a special kind of database. If a mistake is made, developers can turn back the clock and compare earlier
		      versions of the code to help fix the mistake while minimizing disruption to all team members.
