Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for creating and displaying pages on web.Each HTML page consists of a set of tags (also called elements), which we can refer to as the building blocks of web pages. They create a hierarchy that structures the content into sections, paragraphs, headings, and other content blocks.HTML5 is the latest version of HTML.
