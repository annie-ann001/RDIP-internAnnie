                                                           Forking a Github Repository
                                                           
                                        step 1: Log in to your Githib account
                                        step 2: Find the GitHub repository with which you’d like to work.
                                        step 3: Click the Fork button on the upper right-hand side of the repository’s page.
                                          Now you have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.
                                        step 4: Click on code option and to clone the repository using HTTPS, copy the link under "Clone with HTTPS".
                                        step 5: Open Git Bash.
                                        step 6: Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory.
                                        step 7: Type git clone, and paste the URL you copied earlier.
                                        step 8: Press Enter.
                                          Your local clone will be created.When you fork a project in order to propose changes to the original repository, you can configure Git to                                           pull changes from the original, or upstream, repository into the local clone of your fork.
                                        step 9: Type git remote -v and press Enter.
                                          You'll see the current configured remote repository for your fork.
                                        step 10: Type git remote add upstream, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 4 and press Enter.
                                        step 11: To verify the new upstream repository you've specified for your fork, type git remote -v again. 
                                          You can see the URL for your fork as origin, and the URL for the original repository as upstream.
